# Apple iPhone 15 Website Clone

## Project Overview

This project is an educational clone of an Apple-inspired website showcasing the iPhone 15. It is designed to demonstrate my ability to create dynamic, modern, and visually engaging websites. This clone highlights my proficiency in various front-end technologies and contemporary web development practices.

Note: This project is for educational and skill demonstration purposes only. It is not a functional site and is not intended to be presented as one.
